    Under the supervision of Mr. Kolador, the renowned merchant and president of Banges Industries or Banges Tech, played a pivotal role in the development of the small remote settlement known 
    as Banges. As relayed by Hilda, one of the inhabitants referred to as "the people of the game," life in Banges was initially challenging. Faced with adversities like famine caused by pests and

    the settlement faced near annihilation. However, it was Mr. Kolador's contribution that saved them from this dire fate.
