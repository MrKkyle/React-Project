    Warren Snowfield is a region in Aesperia consisting of the Saag passage, Aarniel Fortress, Silvercrown Forest and the
    Southern Naa Fjords. The Saag passage is a small valley among the snow mountains, which twists and 
    turns like a passage in mother nature's yard. The abandoned buildings and machinery along the fjords 
    have revealed their glorious past as a bustling trade dock.
