    The Artificial Island is an area in Aesperia. The Artificial Island was a project started by Banges Tech under the  
    direction of Kolador so that it could be a new place for everyone to live in, however due to the Heirs of Aida
    attacking Banges Tech, the project was stalled.
    Following the reconstruction of Banges Tech, the Artificial Island project was resumed, however the island is now
    inhabited by many hostile groups, such as the Hyenas.
