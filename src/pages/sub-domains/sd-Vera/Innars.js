    Innars is an area in Vera. Innars is an artificially constructed city known as the "Second City", preceding the construction of the now defunct Third City. Innars is located northwest of Mirroria, 
    and extends all the way from an underground cave to the bottom of the sea.Innars was constructed by Mirroria to accommodate as a second city, in order to divert Mirroria's 
    increasing population. Innars was built underground due to the lethal Omnium pollution and radiation levels that remain on the surface of Vera.
